## **Why This Tool?**

- **Cost-Efficient** – Generate lead lists at the fraction of the cost of other scrapers
- **Fully Automated** – Handles the entire process from location search to lead enrichment
- **Contact Detail Extraction** – Automatically finds emails, social media profiles, and more
- **Smart Web Scraping** – Uses AI to navigate websites and extract relevant information
- **Ready-to-Use Output** – Generates Excel files you can immediately use for outreach
- **Multi-LLM Integration** – Choose any AI models like GPT-4.1, Claude or DeepSeek to run your search

## **How It Works**

The tool workflow is simple:

### 1. Data Collection
- Takes a location and search query input (e.g., "Toronto", "Realtors")
- Uses **Serper Maps API** to scrape Google Maps places data
- Returns a list of relevant places with basic information (business name, address, website, phone, etc.)

### 2. Data Enrichment
- For each business found, the tool scrapes their website (landing or contact pages)
- Uses an **AI agent (LLM)** to intelligently identify:
  - Email addresses
  - Detailed contact information
  - Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc)
  - Other relevant data points for outreach

### 3. Data Export
- Saves all collected and enriched data to an Excel file, under the `data` directory
- Organizes information in a clean, ready-to-use format for sales outreach

## **Cost Implications**

While other Google Maps scrapers like [Apify's Google Maps Extractor](https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-extractor) or [Crawler Google Places](https://apify.com/compass/crawler-google-places) charge **$5-10 per 1000 results** (depending on the options you choose), this system leverages the Serper API and efficient web scraping to deliver the same results for approximately **$0.2 per 1000 leads** – that's up to **50x cheaper**!

Even better, Serper API offers **free credits** when you sign up, making your initial lead generation campaigns essentially **free**!
